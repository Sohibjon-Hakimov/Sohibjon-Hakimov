"Detached HEAD" is a state in Git where you're no longer working on any branch. Instead, you're directly referencing a specific commit. This can happen intentionally, like when you're inspecting past commits or experimenting with changes without affecting branches. Essentially, you're free-floating, detached from the normal flow of commits tied to a branch. It's akin to being in a temporary workspace where changes aren't automatically part of any branch until you explicitly create one or switch back to an existing branch.
